.SH NAME
matrix_shell

A simple command interpreter
.SH SYNOPSIS
command [-o option_name] [command_file [argument ...]]

.SH DESCRIPTION
matrix_shell
is a basic command line interpreter based on the first Unix shell 'sh', created by Ken Thompson in 1971. matrix_shell is intentionally minimalistic and contains functionality for only the most essential shell tasks: accepting input, parsing the input into a command and its arguments, and executing that input. Error checking is straightforward and follows Bash conventions.

.SH INVOCATION

When no arguments are provided and the shell's standard input is connected to a terminal, the shell operates in interactive mode. An interactive shell typically prompts before each command and handles programming and command errors differently. Upon startup, the shell examines argument 0.

If command-line arguments are specified in addition to the options, the shell interprets the first argument as the name of a file containing commands (a shell script), and the remaining arguments are set as the positional parameters of the shell ($1, $2, etc.). Otherwise, the shell reads commands from its standard input.
